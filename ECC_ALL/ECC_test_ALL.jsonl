I really appreciate your understanding and support. It means a lot to me.\nVet: Of course. We're here for you and your dog every step of the way. You're both in our thoughts.\nCarly:  Thank you. I'll do whatever it takes to make sure he's comfortable and at peace.\nVet: That's all we can ask for. And when the time comes, we'll make sure he's surrounded by love and compassion.\nCarly:  I want to be there for him until the very end. He deserves that much.\nVet: He's lucky to have such a caring and devoted owner. You've given him a wonderful life, and now you're making sure his final moments are filled with love and care.\nCarly:  I just hope he knows how much he means to me. I don't want him to ever feel alone.\nVet: He knows, Carly. Dogs have a way of understanding our emotions, and I have no doubt that he knows how much you love him. You've been the best owner anyone could ask for.\nCarly:  Thank you for saying that. It means a lot to me. I just want to make sure he's not in pain anymore.\nVet: We'll make sure he's as comfortable as possible. And we'll be here for you every step of the way. You're not alone in this.\nCarly:  Okay. I'll do whatever it takes to make sure he's at peace. Thank you for helping me through this."}

Thank you for understanding.\nPresley:  Okay, I appreciate that you're taking responsibility and trying to make things right. Just know that it's going to take a lot to make up for this. I'll need some time to think about it.\nPreston:  I understand. I'll do whatever it takes. I just want to make things right between us.\nPresley:  I know you do, Preston. Just be more careful in the future, okay?\nPreston:  Absolutely, I will. Thank you for giving me a chance to make it up to you, Presley. I won't let you down again.\nPresley:  I hope not. Just know that this really hurt, but I appreciate your efforts to make it right. Let's just take it one step at a time.\nPreston:  One step at a time. Thank you, Presley. I won't let you down."}

Just remember, confidence comes from believing in yourself and your abilities. You've got this. And if you ever feel unsure, just come talk to me. I'll always be here to lift you up.\nPerson 1: Thanks, Randy. I really appreciate your support.\nRandy: Of course. We all need someone to lean on sometimes. And I know you're going to do great. Just trust in yourself and everything will fall into place.\nPerson 1: I'll keep that in mind. Thanks again, Randy. You're the best.\nRandy: You're welcome.
