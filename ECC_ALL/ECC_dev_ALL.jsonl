But I need to know that you're not going to be a liability.\nLuca: I'm not trying to be a liability. I just want to do my job to the best of my ability.\nMargaret: Then prove it. Show me that I can trust you to fall in line and follow orders without question.\nLuca: But what if I don't agree with your orders? What if I think there's a better way?\nMargaret: There is no room for insubordination here, Luca. You either do what you're told, or you don't belong here.\nLuca: I just can't shake this feeling of fear and unease. It feels like you're trying to control me, and I don't like it.\nMargaret: Fear can be a powerful motivator, Luca. Use it to your advantage. But remember, I'm the one in control here.\nLuca: I don't want to be manipulated or controlled. I just want to do my job and be respected.\nMargaret: Then do as you're told, and you will have my respect. It's as simple as that."}

But it feels like a luxury to take time for myself to do those things.\nPerson 2: It's not a luxury, it's a necessity. You need to make time for the things that bring you joy and relaxation. It will help you handle the stress at work better.\nGenevieve: You're right. I need to prioritize self-care. I'll make a plan to incorporate those activities into my routine.\nPerson 2: That's great to hear.

I've heard from other people that Walter isn't as dedicated as he seems.\nOliver: I don't care what other people say. I know Walter and I know how hard he works. I won't stand by and let you or anyone else talk about him like that. He's a role model to me and I won't let anyone tarnish his reputation. It's important for me to support him because I truly believe in him and his work ethic.\nPerson 2: Okay, okay, I didn't realize you felt so strongly about this. It's just, I've had some bad experiences with Walter in the past and it's hard for me to see him in the same way as you do.\nOliver: I understand that, but we all have our flaws and make mistakes. I just think it's important to focus on the positive aspects of Walter and not let a few missteps overshadow his overall dedication and drive. It's important for me to defend him because I truly look up to him and his work ethic.\nPerson 2: I hear what you're saying. I guess I should give Walter another chance and try to see him from your perspective. Thanks for standing up for your friend, Oliver.\nOliver: Of course, I'll always stand up for those I respect and admire. It's important to me to support the people who have a positive impact on me and Walter is definitely one of those people. Plus, it feels good to defend someone who I believe in and care about."}
